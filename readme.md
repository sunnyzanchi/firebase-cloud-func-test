# Firebase Cloud Function Example
Just a quick example I made from a while back when I was testing out Firebase's Cloud Functions. This is a really simple example, there's a cloud function @ `/api` that is a GraphQL server. It only has one query (`testing`) and it returns the string `"hell yea"`, but it's an actual, serverless GraphQL server.
